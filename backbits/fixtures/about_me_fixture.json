        "description": "After I earned my chemical engineer bachelor's degree at Unicamp and finished my senior thesis that included process engineering, software engineering and neural networks, I realized how fascinating software development really is. For this reason I decided that I needed a career change and switched from chemical engineering to software engineering.\r\n\r\nI'd define myself as an autodidact developer who loves learning new technologies in order to create new and creative solutions! I have experience with the following languages: Ruby, Javascript, Typescript, Java and Lisp. However, Python is definitely the language that I am most confortable with, so I'd say that it is my main language.\r\n\r\nI'm passionate about high-quality and test driven software development. I definitely love creating state-of-the-art software in which the user experience is essential.\r\n\r\nI'm also always looking for new ways to improve myself after work! Hence, I contribute or develop open source projects!",
