[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/ambv/black)

Mybits is a dockerized and responsive project that contains some bits (info) about me and a chatbot to answer questions! 

## Built with

* Python 3.7.1;
* Django (backend and content management);
* Django Rest Framework (RESTful api development);
* Angular (frontend);
* Tox and pytest for testing;
* Gulp for frontend project building and file moving to Django folders.

## Mybits Demo

## Features

* A socket-based web chat which can be used to ask a bot some info about me such as my name, age, etc;

* An about-me section with some more detailed info about me;

* A section with my favorite github projects;

* A section that describes some important skills that I have been improving over the time;

* Section with my contacts (linkedin, github, etc.).

## File Summary

Here's a list of most important files which compose the structure of the project:

### Config-related files

```Dockerfile```: dockerfile to generate the container of the application; <br/>
```docker-compose```: docker-compose file to generate all the containers of the application;  <br/>
```docker-entrypoint.sh```: shell script used to run the application;  <br/>
```test.sh```: shell script to run the tests of the application.  <br/>

### Django-related files (Backend)

```/backbits```: package with the Django backend app;  <br/>
```/backbits/static/backbits```: package with all the static files required by the application for Django's development server;  <br/>
```/backbits/templates```: package with index.html generated by Angular for Django's development server;  <br/>
```/backbits/bot/```: package with the chat bot logic;  <br/>
```/backbits/media```: folder with uploaded files required to run the application locally.  <br/>

### Angular-related files (Frontend)
```/backbits/frontbits```: folder with the Angular app used to generate the frontend;  <br/>
```/backbits/frontbits/gulpfile.js```: gulpfile developed to move frontend files to django's assets folder and templates folder;  <br/>
```/backbits/frontbits/angular.json```: angular configurations in order to run with django;  <br/>

## Local Development

### Starting the backend and the frontend (angular)

In order to run this application, just clone this repo and run the following command!

```docker-compose up```

Since this is a fully dockerized application, starting the application is pretty straight forward!
This starts the development server on port 5005 which serves the Django app. The docker-entrypoint file
will perform the necessary migrations and also collect all static files which can be later used in deployments.

### Starting the frontend only (angular serve)

In order to run just the angular app (no backend server), just run the following command inside
the frontbits folder:

```ng serve``` or ```gulp serve```

### Building the full application

In order to build the angular app and transfer all of its compiled files to be served by Django,
just run the following commands:

Inside the fronbits folder, run:

```gulp build-dev```: this will invoke ng build with the appropriate args and transfer the compiled files
to Django's appropriate folders;

Then, just execute the django server by running the following command on any folder:

```docker-compose up```

That's it! We compiled all the frontend code and transfered them to be served by Django!

## Tests

This application uses Tox to manage environments and run tests. In order to run, just invoke:

```tox```

## Deployment instructions

The bash script ```deploy.sh``` uses the rsync command to transfer safely the application files to a remote webserver. Hence, to deploy code to a remote instance:

```bash
source deploy.sh
```
