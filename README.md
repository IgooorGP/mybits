# My Bits

A dockerized responsive open-source website that contains some bits about me! Developed in Python with the Django framework for the backend and Angular framework for the frontend. Besides that, Gulp was used to move all the compiled files from Angular to the appropriate Django folders in order to connect front end files with the backend code!
